ECSy [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/lox/ecsy.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/lox/ecsy)
=============

> ðŸš¨ **This is very old and out-of-date**: Check out https://github.com/aws/copilot-cli. (Also I'm sorry AWS folks, I wasn't as kind as I should have been in those issues).

A tool for managing and deploying ECS clusters, because the [official one](https://github.com/aws/amazon-ecs-cli) is [terrible](#why-not-amazon-ecs-cli)

Originally `99designs/ecs-cli`, many thanks to those guys for being awesome and making it possible for me to release it open-source.

## Features

 * CloudFormation based - Network stack, ECS cluster and ECS services
 * Support for managing ECS services with ELB loadbalancers
 * Designed for managing many ECS clusters
 * Built-in support for common third-party services like Datadog
 * Derives ECS Task Definitions from docker-compose v2 definitions

## Installing

```
go install github.com/lox/ecsy@latest
```

## Usage

### Create a new ECS Cluster with your app running

```bash
# create an ecs cluster and supporting infrastructure (vpc, autoscale group, security groups, etc)
ecsy create-cluster --cluster example --keyname lox --type m4.large --count 4

# create an ecs task and service from a docker-compose file
ecsy create-service --cluster example -f docker-compose.yml
```

### Deploy a new release of your app to a service created above

```bash
# Creates and deploys a new task with the helloworld container updated with a new image tag
ecsy deploy --cluster example -f docker-compose.yml helloworld=:v2
```

## Building

Setup the build dependencies.

```
make setup
```

Install ecsy.

```
make install
```

### Why not amazon-ecs-cli?

The main issue with `amazon-ecs-cli` is that it tries to emulate the `docker-compose` interface, which isn't a sensible abstraction and ends up making the architecture overly complicated. Contributing the changes we wanted upstream just wasn't viable, and beyond that issues go unanswered and development seems stagnant:
